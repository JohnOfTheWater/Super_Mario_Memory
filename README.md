Super Mario Memory
============================

Super Mario Memory is a browser-based logic puzzle game. Click on the question mark boxes to flip them and try to find the correct match, but watch out! If you make too many mistakes will be game over and you have to start again with a new randomly generated set of pictures!

This app makes heavy use of Node.js, and displays each player's game via client-side jQuery. MongoDB is used to store the players and their  personal hi-scores in a persistent leaderboard!
